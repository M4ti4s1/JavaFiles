Sure, here's the exercise:

**Banking System**

Create a Java program to simulate a simple banking system. Your program should include the following classes:

1. **Customer**: Represents a bank customer. Each customer should have a name, address, and one or more accounts. The class should have methods to add accounts and retrieve them.
    Do it with 1 account first

2. **Account**: Represents a bank account. Each account should have an account number and a balance. The class should have methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and check the balance.

Your program should also include a main class (`BankingSystem`) with the following functionalities:

- Create at least two customers and a few accounts for each customer.
- Perform some transactions such as depositing money into an account, withdrawing money from an account, and transferring money between accounts.
- Display the updated balance after each transaction.

Feel free to extend the functionalities or add more classes as needed. The goal is to create a simple but functional banking system using classes and methods in Java.
